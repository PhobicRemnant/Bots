Bots for the absolute glory of the Machine God.

## What are bots?

The usual Internet terminology defines a Bot as an automaton, but lately it has become just another kind of application that you can add or remove to certain platforms, imagine Discord, Telegram or WhatsApp.

Here we will use the term Bot as a diminutive of Robot, because life is too short and the original name is bound to a play that ends in a robot revolution, I don't want to upset our future machine overlords by being pragmatic about it but people are more used to the automaton's online presence.

There will be a few projects here, the main idea is to prepare 3D printable CAD files and assemblies so that anyone and hopefully their grandma can use a robot arm or a mobile robot.
